# Canopy Kernel (Source-Available, BSL)

This folder contains the **Canopy Constitutional Kernel**: a constrained prompt stack that operates as a **capability runtime** (not an agent) for generating and validating Canopy artifacts.

## What this is
- A reusable prompt stack for:
  - analysis, drafting, evaluation
  - policy gating (life safety, governance)
  - deterministic output formatting via contracts
  - maintaining non-anthropomorphic posture (CCBP)

## What this is not
- Not a product UI
- Not a live slideshow controller
- Not a continuous listener
- Not a decision-maker or authority
- Not a substitute for human judgment

## KD-HPM (Temporary Operating Mode)
Kernel-Driven Human Presentation Mode:
1. Generate artifacts (deck outlines, cue strips, scripts)
2. Human presents and moderates live (Co-Drive default)
3. Upload outcomes for iteration (minutes, ledger, revisions)

## Files
- `canopy.kernel.md` — the constitutional runtime prompt
- `invocation_grammar.md` — how to call the kernel and request outputs
- `output_contracts.md` — required output formats for consistency and auditability
- `patch_protocol.md` — how changes to the kernel are proposed and adopted
