# Canopy Governance Overview (External-Facing)

This document summarizes Canopy’s governance posture and session behavior.
It is intended to reduce ambiguity for institutional stakeholders.

## Core Guarantees

### Never capture by default
Canopy does not capture session or project outputs by default.

Capture eligibility exists only when it is explicitly declared at session or project entry.

When capture is not explicitly declared at entry:
- Canopy will not designate any outputs as proprietary within the system.
- Canopy will not apply ownership, restriction, or exclusivity retroactively.
- Capture status is final and cannot be changed later.

In short:
- No default capture
- No retroactive capture
- No reinterpretation of intent

### No retroactive policy changes
No retroactive policy changes apply to sessions or artifacts created under prior policies.

## Session Model (High Level)

### Session states
- **Presentation**: viewing, facilitation, discussion
- **Draft**: governed, provisional system and automation drafting (logged; non-final)
- **Closed**: session ends; participation linkage dissolves

### Authority
A designated **session runtime account** controls Draft entry/exit and (optionally) draft locking.

### Consent
Session participation is established through deliberate entry (e.g., dynamic, session-specific passcode).
Consent is contextual and time-bounded; it ends when the session ends.

## Integrity (Optional)
Canopy may anchor governance events using on-chain, non-intelligible tokens (NITs) to provide proof of timing and sequence without revealing content or identities.
