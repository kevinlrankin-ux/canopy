# Canopy

Canopy is a governance-first, session-based collaboration and system-orchestration framework
designed for high-trust institutional environments.

It prioritizes explicit authority, time-bounded consent, and non-retroactive governance
over default capture or silent data reuse.

## Governance posture (external-facing)

Canopy follows a conservative governance posture:
- Never capture by default
- Explicit authority (session runtime account)
- Time-bounded consent (session-scoped participation)
- No retroactive policy changes for prior sessions or artifacts
