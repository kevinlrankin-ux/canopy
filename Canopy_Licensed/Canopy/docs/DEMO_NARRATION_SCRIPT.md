# Canopy — Demo Narration Script (CCBP-aligned)

**Intent:** Reinforce Canopy as an *environment* that holds coherence, not an actor that leads.

## 0) Setup (10–15 seconds)
> “Today I’m demoing **Canopy**. Canopy is the environment we use to keep instruction, meetings, and safety states coherent—without taking authority away from the people in the room.”

> “I’ll run this in **Co-Drive** mode, which means I’m the operator. Canopy provides structure, timing, and safeguards.”

## 1) What Canopy is (20 seconds)
> “Think of Canopy as a runtime layer: it organizes the presentation flow, supports formative checks, and keeps procedural order when needed.”

> “Canopy does not decide outcomes. It helps people run the work in a way that’s clear and auditable.”

## 2) Quick tour of the live flow (60–90 seconds)
### Slide flow
> “I can advance, pause, and branch through material. The structure is designed to reduce friction, not replace instruction.”

### Formative mind awareness (signals)
> “Participants can submit low-friction signals—like a quick check-in or a short response. These are participation signals by default, not identity tracking.”

### Q&A moderation (if enabled)
> “Questions enter a queue. Moderation is predictable: timeboxing, rate limits, and export-safe summaries.”

## 3) Governance mode (optional, 60 seconds)
> “In governance contexts—boards, unions, advisory boards—Canopy can run a formal ‘rules of order’ vocabulary. The chair remains the chair.”

> “Motions and votes are recorded as append-only entries, and minutes are human-attested.”

## 4) Life Safety precedence (45 seconds)
> “Life safety overrides everything. If a drill or incident is activated, Canopy switches to a silent dark screen with minimal neutral text.”

> “During that mode, inputs, exports, and narration are suppressed. Returning requires verified clearance under the configured policy.”

## 5) Offline resilience (30 seconds)
> “If connectivity drops, the core flow continues. Safety modes still work offline, and events sync later with tamper-evident logging.”

## 6) Close (20 seconds)
> “The goal is operational clarity: less noise, more coherence, and stronger safety guarantees.”

> “Canopy holds the space. People do the work.”

## Optional 15-second Q&A framing
> “If you have concerns, the right questions are: what data is collected, who can trigger safety states, and how records are attested. Those are all policy-bound and auditable.”
