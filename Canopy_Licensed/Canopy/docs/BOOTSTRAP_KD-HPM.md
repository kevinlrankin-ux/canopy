# KD-HPM (Kernel-Driven Human Presentation Mode)

## Purpose
Run pilots and demos **without** building the full platform yet.

## Operating ritual (repeatable)
### Pre-session
- Prepare: deck + cue strip + safety text preview
- Confirm: Co-Drive mode, recording OFF, export profile

### During session
- Human presents and moderates
- Canopy kernel remains non-live (no continuous listening)

### Post-session
Upload (or paste) into the kernel thread:
- deck used
- session notes / outcomes
- Q&A summary
- motions/votes (if governance)

Kernel outputs:
- revised deck
- minutes + motion ledger drafts
- AAR inputs
- improvement deltas
