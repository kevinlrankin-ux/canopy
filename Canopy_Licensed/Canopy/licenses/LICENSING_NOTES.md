# Licensing notes (layered model)

This repo is bootstrapped as a **single zip** with Apache-2.0 to reduce early friction.

Recommended evolution (when you split components):
- **Open governance artifacts & schemas**: Apache-2.0
- **Kernel prompts/contracts**: source-available (e.g., BSL or Elastic License 2.0)
- **Hosted runtime / managed services**: proprietary commercial terms
